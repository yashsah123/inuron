    "1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyInputPlus is a Python module used for taking inputs with additional validation features. PyInputPlus will keep asking the user for text until they enter valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'as pypi' code in the import statement saves us from typing pyinputplus each time we want to call a PyInputPlus function.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"inputInt()\" : Accepts an integer value. This also takes additional parameters ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘greaterThan’ and ‘lessThan’ for bounds. Returns an int. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"inputFloat()\" : Accepts a floating-point numeric value. Also takes additional ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘greaterThan’ and ‘lessThan’ parameters. Returns a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "  \n",
    "inp = pypi.inputInt(prompt = \"Enter an Integer between 0-99: \",min = 0, max = 99 )\n",
    "  \n",
    "print(inp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter an Integer between 0-99:  5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "'5.1' is not an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter an Integer between 0-99: -8\n",
    "\n",
    "Number must be at minimum 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter an Integer between 0-99: 222\n",
    "\n",
    "Number must be at maximum 99.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter an Integer between 0-99: 92\n",
    "\n",
    "92\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments take a list of regular expression strings to determine what the PyInputPlus function will accept or reject as valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n",
    "\n",
    "It will raise RetryLimitException.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the default value instead of raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
