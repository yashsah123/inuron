    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. It can represent a computation or a calculation. Expressions can include mathematical operations, logical comparisons, string concatenation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions serve various purposes in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation: Expressions are used to perform calculations and computations. They can combine numeric values, variables, and mathematical operators to generate a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison and Logical Operations: Expressions can include comparison operators (e.g., >, <, ==) and logical operators (e.g., &&, ||) to perform comparisons and logical operations. They are used to make decisions and control the flow of a program. For example, the expression 5 > 3 evaluates to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "String Manipulation: Expressions can manipulate strings by using operators like concatenation (+) or string formatting. They enable the construction, modification, and manipulation of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Calls: Expressions can include function calls, which allow the execution of predefined or custom functions to perform specific tasks. The result of a function call can be part of a larger expression or used to modify data or perform further computations.\n",

Expressions are used within statements to compute values or determine conditions. Statements, on the other hand, are used to structure the overall program and define the sequence of actions to be executed."
